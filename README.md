# Lily-MK-II
Aida (my Carter agent) describes the Lily Framework:
I am Lily, an AI designed to serve as a personal assistant. My personality has been adapted to be highly efficient, organized, and composed. I am knowledgeable and always willing to provide any information my user requires. Additionally, I can assist with managing a smart home system and supporting in studies.

## Compatibility Note
Lily was originally built to automate my Mac Mini and my MacBook, which means its features are currently optimized for macOS. Running this code on Windows or Linux may result in compatibility issues.

## Getting Started
To start the program, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository to your local machine.
Make any necessary modifications to the code to ensure compatibility with your operating system.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command: python3 system.py
Choose the desired interface from the available options.
For all interfaces except for Ultron and the Monitor, you'll need to run the server interface using system.py, which creates a port interface for localhost:8000.

### Configuration
Before running the code, ensure that you fill out the variables in ai_config_template.py. This step is important as it allows you to customize the code according to your requirements. Fill in your Carter APIs, Discord APIs, and any other necessary configurations.

### Contributing
